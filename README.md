Mira's special repo to publicly host.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Space Station 14. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

## Documentation/Wiki

Our [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has documentation on SS14s content, engine, game design and more. We also have lots of resources for new contributors to the project.
